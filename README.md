## **Overview**
This repo contains various data driven applications I have built over time. In addition, some applications maybe part of a group project during one of the many courses I had enrolled in. Organization of content helps me to document, my passion for building data driven application and any learnings I have garnered along the way. 

Everythng built is in the spirit of open source so feel free to use and star the repo if beneficical :). Applications are built based on specific AI techniques, domain knowledge, niche use cases, use of open source programming libraries, and distributed applications. All this is built using various open source technologies
