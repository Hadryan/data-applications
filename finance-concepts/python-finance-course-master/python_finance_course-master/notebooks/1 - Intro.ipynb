    "### Markets Quantitative Analysis (MQA)\n",
    "\n",
    "MQA is part of the Insitutional Clients Group (ICG) within Citi. Our main focus is to provide quantitative support for ICG Markets. MQA is present (by descending order of size) in New York, London, Budapest and other offices (Houston, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong). In Budapest our team has currently 30+ collegues sitting at Bank Center (two blocks from here). As MQA's remit spans multiple disciplines, we have team members with diverse backgrounds: Quants with Math and Physics degrees, Quantitative Developers and Quant Support with many types of IT background. MQA provides solutions to deal with the complex tasks around analysing OTC traded and market traded financial products. The main asset classes we work with are Rates, FX, Commodities, Equities, Mortgages and Multi asset products. We work in multiple programming languages and apply several tools. We are heavy users of C++, Python and Excel. Other coding languages we use frequently include Matlab, R and Perl.\n",
